      <link>https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/3644028846252008595?l=english</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Today we’re updating the CS2 Limited Test with a new map (Inferno!) and the all new CS Rating. <br/><br/>Your CS Rating is a visible measurement of your Counter-Strike performance, and it will determine where you stand on global and regional leaderboards. To get your CS Rating, play matches in the updated Premier mode (our Active Duty Pick-Ban competitive mode) either on your own or with your friends.<br/><br/><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="748" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s6BNHro0vSg;full" style="width: 748px; height: 420px;" width="748"></iframe><br/><br/>Additionally, today we’re starting the process of inviting as many eligible players as possible to the Limited Test. To be eligible for a CS2 Limited Test invite players must have CS:GO Prime status, an active official competitive matchmaking Skill Group, and play majority of their official matchmaking games in one of the regions where the Limited Test is available.<br/><br/><div class="bbcodes_Header3_2q6Vr BB_Header3">Saving Time</div>Over the past decade, we’ve shipped updates to the economy and weapon balance to trim the fat and reduce the number of uncontested rounds in a match of CS.<br/><br/>Because of these changes, exciting competitive matches can be resolved with fewer rounds. And shorter matches mean players can play more, and more often. So with CS2, we’re moving to a maximum of 24 rounds in regulation time (with a 6 round overtime in case of a tie) for Premier, Competitive, and the Majors.<br/><br/>We expect the structure and flow of matches to evolve over time as the community adapts. And we’re excited to see where they go next.<br/>]]></description>

      <title>A Level Playing Field</title>
      <link>https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/3677802763035982969?l=english</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Counter-Strike is at its best when teams compete on a level playing field and when ability is the only limit to their success. <br/><br/>Over the past few years, we’ve seen professional Counter-Strike drift away from that ideal. The ecosystem has become gradually less open, with access to the highest levels of competition increasingly gated by business relationships. <br/><br/>We think that Counter-Strike should be an open sport. So we’re going to add new requirements to running large-scale competitive events. The finer details are still in progress, but here are the broad strokes:<br/><ul class="bbcodes_List_20uQh"><li class="bbcodes_ListItem_1BF9I"> Tournament organizers will no longer have unique business relationships or other conflicts of interest with teams that participate in their events. <br/><br/></li><li class="bbcodes_ListItem_1BF9I"> Invitations to all tournaments will use our ranking system (detailed <a class="Focusable" href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=https://github.com/ValveSoftware/counter-strike/tree/main/regional_standings" rel="noopener nofollow" tabindex="0"><span data-tooltip-text="github.com">here</span></a>), or otherwise be determined by open qualifiers. <br/><br/></li><li class="bbcodes_ListItem_1BF9I"> Any compensation for participating teams—prize pool or otherwise—will be made public and will be driven by objective criteria that can be inspected by the community. <br/></li></ul>Since tournament organizers have existing long term commitments, these requirements will take effect as of 2025. There will be some rough edges to the transition, but we’re committed to the long-term health of Counter-Strike as a sport and are looking forward to its bright and open future.<br/>]]></description>
