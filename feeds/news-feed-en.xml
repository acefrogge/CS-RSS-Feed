      <title>Season Two: Episode One</title>
      <link>https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/529852487375519751?l=english</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images//3381077/f780ca0f8f1f5561b4f72030672ed657382ecd9a.png"/><br/>Premier Season Three begins today!<br/><br/>It's time to start working toward your Season Three Medal. As before, the color of your medal will correspond to the highest CS Rating achieved during the season, and the bars will reflect your total wins, with one bar for every 25 (up to five bars). To be eligible for a medal, you'll need an account in good standing, 25 Premier match wins, and an active CSR at the end of the season.<br/><br/><div class="bbcodes_Header3_2q6Vr BB_Header3">New for Season 3 </div>With the new season comes an update to the Active Duty Map Pool: Overpass is back in, and Anubis is out.<br/><br/>There are a few gameplay changes with Season Three. Fire from the incendiary grenade now spreads faster, occupying space rapidly to counter rushing Ts. The MP9 has gotten a bit of a nerf, with a harder to control spray and substantially less jumping accuracy. There's also a change to the CT economy: win or lose, CTs now receive a shared team award for each T eliminated in the round, so the more you win and the closer you keep your losses, the more you'll have to spend.<br/><br/><div class="bbcodes_Header3_2q6Vr BB_Header3">Trade Protected Items</div>Today we are introducing a new feature to help keep your Counter-Strike items secure. In the unlikely event that you lose control of your account or were the target of a scam by a bad actor, you may reverse all Counter-Strike item trades from the last 7 days. <br/><br/>Obviously we hope you'll never need it, but you can review your recent trades and find the trade reversal feature on the Trade History page on your Steam Account. For more information about what happens when trades are reversed, visit the <a class="Focusable" href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/365F-4BEE-2AE2-7BDD" tabindex="0"><span data-tooltip-text="help.steampowered.com">FAQ</span></a>]]></description>

To receive your Premier Season Two Medal, you must have 25 Season Two Premier wins and a visible CSR when the Season concludes.<br/><br/>See you soon for Premier Season Three!]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Welcome to Premier Season Two. <br/><br/>If you haven't heard the news, here's what's new in Season Two. Vertigo is out, Train is in, the M4A4 is more... A4-dable... and we've tweaked the FAMAS. <br/><br/>Season Two runs from now through the Austin Major, at which point players who meet the requirements will be awarded a Premier Season Two Medal. The color will correspond to your highest CS Rating achieved during the season, and the bars will reflect your total wins, with one bar for every 25—up to five bars.<br/><br/>To earn your Premier Season Two Medal, you'll need an account in good standing, 25 Premier match wins, and an active CSR at the end of the season.<br/><br/>Premier matchmaking is now open for business, so hit the queue and start racking up those wins!]]></description>

To celebrate, every player who earned a CS Rating during Season One will receive a commemorative Premier Season One Medal. Your medal includes detailed Season Statistics that you can view by clicking on the medal in your inventory. Review your Season One highs and lows with graphs of your CSR and playtime, or view your map-specific stats to find areas of improvement for Season Two.<br/><br/>As we transition to Season Two, there'll be one day of Premier downtime during which your CS Rating will be recalibrated for the new season based on your Season One performance. At the start of the new Season you will need to re-establish your CS Rating by winning 10 matches.<br/><br/><video autoplay="" crossorigin="anonymous" height="auto" loop="" playsinline="" poster="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/d495453498221843cfda536124bcc4fcc900047b.png?origin=" width="100%"><source src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/6e803fe05de9235ccca66ba9fdcd8a083d4ff55a.mp4?origin=" type="video/mp4"/><source src="https://clan.fastly.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/fed939de66b4f14899ed743a4201d163b260341a.webm?origin=" type="video/webm"/></video><br/>Season Two comes with some changes. Train is in and Vertigo is out, the M4A4 is a bit less expensive, and the FAMAS has some improvements to its standing and crouching accuracy (along with a price cut).<br/><br/>And when Season Two comes to a close after the Austin Major, players who meet the requirements will be awarded a Premier Season Two Medal.
