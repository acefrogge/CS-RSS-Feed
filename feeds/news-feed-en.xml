      <title>Introducing TrueView</title>
      <link>https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/578276333072678918?l=english</link>
      <description><![CDATA[<p class="_23SXWVQfREeO5DYXHTgcWK">Today we're adding a new feature to demo playback called <i class="_2sLD_9cqZHBt1uEyploWlP BB_Italic">TrueView</i>. With TrueView, demo playback will match the player's original experience much more closely.<br></p><p class="_23SXWVQfREeO5DYXHTgcWK">Previously, demo playback showed the server's view of the world, without accounting for network latency. This could be confusing because shots would hit that didn't look like they should have, and vice versa. <br></p><p class="_23SXWVQfREeO5DYXHTgcWK">TrueView provides a more accurate representation of the observed player's experience by re-running their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FClient-side_prediction" class="Focusable" rel="noopener nofollow"><i class="_2sLD_9cqZHBt1uEyploWlP BB_Italic">client-side prediction</i></a>.<br></p><p class="_23SXWVQfREeO5DYXHTgcWK">The video below shows the difference between the old demo playback and the same playback with TrueView.<br></p><p class="_23SXWVQfREeO5DYXHTgcWK"><video width="100%" height="auto" autoplay="" playsinline="" poster="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images//3381077/62030ce08e8f12c926a4f6d935273d4dd68eb0bb.jpg?origin=" loop=""><source src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images//3381077/9ca1d515aebe8c11b94bcd3dd1ee9f28c02f0909.mp4?origin=" type="video/mp4"><source src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images//3381077/9a8ab6de516a3c52f5d76f2174fd45976d8203b2.webm?origin=" type="video/webm"></video><br></p><p class="_23SXWVQfREeO5DYXHTgcWK">A few caveats:<br></p><ul class="cSK6EVcVDQVi2-u8iuoJJ bullets"><li class="_3hRXlwV68b7y5e5EjN2HQy"><p class="_23SXWVQfREeO5DYXHTgcWK">By default, TrueView is deactivated when the version of the game you are using to view the demo does not match the version of the game used to record the demo.<br></p></li><li class="_3hRXlwV68b7y5e5EjN2HQy"><p class="_23SXWVQfREeO5DYXHTgcWK">Even with TrueView active, there may still be some differences between what you see in the demo and what the player originally saw (especially with slow-motion playback). For example, damage effects will have different timing during demo playback due to the way CPU and GPU work are pipelined.<br></p></li><li class="_3hRXlwV68b7y5e5EjN2HQy"><p class="_23SXWVQfREeO5DYXHTgcWK">In addition to performing clientside prediction of the observed player, TrueView will also perform Damage Prediction on enemies, if Damage Prediction was used by the observed player at the time. <br></p></li></ul><p class="_23SXWVQfREeO5DYXHTgcWK"><br></p><p class="_23SXWVQfREeO5DYXHTgcWK">Additionally, we're shipping movement changes that we made available last week in a beta branch.

As before, the color of your medal will correspond to the highest CS Rating achieved during the season, and the bars will reflect your total wins, with one bar for every 25 (up to five bars). To be eligible for a medal, you'll need an account in good standing, 25 Premier match wins, and an active CSR at the end of the season.<br><br><h3 class="_3TbsqSojZISxIQAjLdNVPr BB_Header3">New for Season 3 </h3>With the new season comes an update to the Active Duty Map Pool: Overpass is back in, and Anubis is out.<br><br>There are a few gameplay changes with Season Three. Fire from the incendiary grenade now spreads faster, occupying space rapidly to counter rushing Ts. The MP9 has gotten a bit of a nerf, with a harder to control spray and substantially less jumping accuracy. There's also a change to the CT economy: win or lose, CTs now receive a shared team award for each T eliminated in the round, so the more you win and the closer you keep your losses, the more you'll have to spend.<br><br><h3 class="_3TbsqSojZISxIQAjLdNVPr BB_Header3">Trade Protected Items</h3>Today we are introducing a new feature to help keep your Counter-Strike items secure. In the unlikely event that you lose control of your account or were the target of a scam by a bad actor, you may reverse all Counter-Strike item trades from the last 7 days. <br><br>Obviously we hope you'll never need it, but you can review your recent trades and find the trade reversal feature on the Trade History page on your Steam Account. For more information about what happens when trades are reversed, visit the <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/365F-4BEE-2AE2-7BDD" class="Focusable">FAQ</a>]]></description>
