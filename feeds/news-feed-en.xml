Train is in and Vertigo is out, the M4A4 is a bit less expensive, and the FAMAS has some improvements to its standing and crouching accuracy (along with a price cut).<br/><br/>And when Season Two comes to a close after the Austin Major, players who meet the requirements will be awarded a Premier Season Two Medal.

Team Spirit and FaZe Clan needed all three maps to determine a champion in front of an excited, sold-out crowd at the SPD Bank Oriental Sports Center.<br/><br/>Down 12:5 on map 3, FaZe Clan battled back with 6 consecutive round wins—and some incredible clutches along the way—to force round 24. With the bomb planted and down to a 1v1, sh1ro's final kill earned Team Spirit their first Major Championship.<br/><br/>Celebrate Team Spirit's win with the Major Champions Capsule, now available for purchase. The capsule features autographs from Team Spirit in paper, glitter, holo, and gold, and 50% of the proceeds go to the players and organizations.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/3ed2c31143f07013ef30373c1458adc84731c04d.png"/><br/>With Shanghai in the books we look forward to the BLAST.tv Major in Austin, Texas.

      <description><![CDATA[We're happy to announce the return of the momentarily lost classic, Train.<br/><br/><video autoplay="" height="auto" loop="" playsinline="" poster="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/2cc311b50abe04bf2c3700216fb80f9a9aa26c36.png?origin=" width="100%"><source src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/bb2e4dbe98255eb95e5aac9fa0728ff4310b07bb.mp4?origin=" type="video/mp4"/><source src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/d9eb0bc560630c27136b997f3f171de4b8176394.webm?origin=" type="video/webm"/></video><br/><br/>There's plenty of classic Counter-Strike in every inch of this map—but we also made sure to mix up the gameplay a bit to keep you Train veterans on your toes.

We guarantee it.<br/><br/>So queue up and get ready to master the newest version of one of Counter-Strike's most iconic maps. Train is now available in casual and competitive game modes.<br/><br/><div class="bbcodes_Header3_2q6Vr BB_Header3">Overpass Updates and New Community Maps</div><br/><img src="https://clan.cloudflare.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/9f20d9e437f8ae93c6f276546599860361b0a50b.png"/><br/>Overpass has received a number of updates based on community feedback, and we're adding four new community maps to the game.

      <title>Side-stepping Skill</title>

      <description><![CDATA[Counter-Strike is constantly evolving. From art, to maps, to inventive plays, and even player input, the CS community shapes the game. <br/><br/>Scripting and automating player commands has always been contentious, but over the years some forms of scripting (e.g., jump-throws) have gained acceptance, as they enable plays that wouldn't otherwise be possible. In fact, jump-throws became such an important part of the game that we've done the work to make them reliable without any special scripting or binds (i.e., by jumping and quickly throwing a grenade).<br/><br/>Developing one's coordination and reaction time has always been key to mastering Counter-Strike.<br/><br/>Recently, some hardware features have blurred the line between manual input and automation, so we've decided to draw a clear line on what is or isn't acceptable in Counter-Strike.<br/><br/>We are no longer going to allow automation (via scripting or hardware) that circumvent these core skills and, moving forward, (and initially--exclusively on Valve Official Servers) players suspected of automating multiple player actions from a single game input may be kicked from their match.<br/><br/>To prevent accidental infractions, in-game binds that include more than one movement and/or attack actions will no longer work (e.g., null-binds and jump-throw binds).<br/><br/>If you have a keyboard that includes an input-automation feature (e.g., "Snap Tap Mode"), be sure to disable the feature before you join a match in order to avoid any interruption to your matches.<br/>]]></description>

      <title>The Real MVP</title>
      <link>https://www.counter-strike.net/newsentry/4194621169493598732?l=english</link>
      <description><![CDATA[Since the launch of CS2, community map mappers have been hard at work creating new experiences and updating some classics. Today, we're excited to add the first community maps to CS2!<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/bbf2dd17698bcba8bae487ca7a0783a441581476.png"/><br/>For those of you who dream of Italian weddings, or airplane manufacture (or both!), we've got you covered. Memento and Assembly are now available in Wingman.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/df15c710ff065c92619e712ecf6ee4492e93ac27.png"/><br/>And if you're in the mood for something a bit more... chaotic, take a dip in the classic Pool Day, which is now available in Arms Race.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/d2ad077ed631514103c5eb83183790cd4829a5f6.png"/><br/>Finally, fight your way through the streets of Thera and Mills in Deathmatch and Casual, and put these maps through their paces in Competitive Matchmaking. <br/><br/>Speaking of Competitive Matchmaking, we've given map-based skill groups an overhaul. In addition to redistributing players across the Skill Groups, we've also made it easier to earn those badges in the first place.<br/><br/><img src="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images/3381077/dda0b5f6d6fa18ac9274627c2b8a5e393d645ad0.png"/><br/><br/>There are a bunch of other fixes and adjustments in today's update, including a brand new MVP panel (and animated MVPs in Premier!) and new ways to optimize your video settings. <br/><br/>Jump into a match and check it out!]]></description>
